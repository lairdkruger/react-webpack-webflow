React - Webpack - Webflow Configuration

    1.  Add div with id="app" to Webflow page    

    2.  a)  For quick development testing from the build folder: 
            set up live server on a local port (click go live at bottom of vscode)
            paste the following before </body> tag on webflow page (change link to the local server)
                <script type="text/javascript" src="http://127.0.0.1:5500/build/bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    2.  b)  For production launch in Webflow:
            convert bundle.js to bundle.txt
            upload .txt file to project media
            copy link of the media upload
            use this link instead of the local server

    3.  Add the following styles:
            <style>
                * {
                    box-sizing: border-box;
                }
                
                body {
                    background: #c3ced0;
                    margin: 0;
                    padding: 0;
                }

                .canvas-container {
                    width: 100%;
                    height: 100vh;
                }
            </style>


Other things:

    The react application can only access window events, not canvas events. In order to do both you need to use Drei's html elements which doesn't keep html stuff to Webflow
    This means that scrolling and mouse events can still add interactivity to the canvas scene though!
